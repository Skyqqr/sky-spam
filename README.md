this is two very simple scripts i made that does simple actions
The one titled 'skyspam' just pastes whatever is in your
clipboard for the amount of times you set. 
The one titled 'Scounter' just counts to whatever number 
you set it to count to, whilst sending said numbers out as if it was from your
keyboard.
